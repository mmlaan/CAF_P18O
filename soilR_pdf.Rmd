## CAF P18O Modeling

- Have tried 3 pool model (vegetation, plant available P, not available P), 3 pool model (tile drain, plant available P, not available P), 2 pool model (plant available P, not available P), 1 pool model (plant available P)

- No models are currently in steady state

- most models having issues calculating systemAge because of non-steady state and pools that do not include both inputs and outputs

- estimated DRP in runoff from Aline's LOADEST results and Katie's WY budgets

- Added plots of transit time changing with estimated DRP based on WY estimates - not sure if this is that helpful

# Available (Mehlich 3) vs. Non-Available (Total P - Mehlich 3) Pools 


#Pools: 

- Plant Available (308.25 kg ha<sup>-1</sup>) (Aline)
  - Average of 2016/2018 0 - 50 cm toe and top slope Mehlich 3-P and bulk density, depth of sampling? (0.5 m)
  - $\frac{\text{45 }mg}{kg}$ * $\frac{\text{1370 }kg}{m^3}$ * 0.5 m * $\frac{\text{10000 }m^2}{ha}$ * $\frac{1 kg}{10^6 mg}$
  
    - Aline has bulk density reported as mg cm<sup>-3</sup>, but this seems wrong. I've been using the reported values as g cm<sup>-3</sup>

<br>

- Hardly Available (4349.75 kg ha<sup>-1</sup>) (Aline)
  - Estimated by subtracting average Mehlich 3-P from average Total P
  - Average of 2016/2018 Total P - Average Mehlich 3-P, bulk density
   - $\frac{\text{0.68 g TP}}{kg}$ - $\frac{\text{0.045 g Mehlich}} {kg}$) * $\frac{\text{1370 }kg}{m^3}$ * 0.5 m * $\frac{\text{10000 }m^2}{ha}$ * $\frac{\text{1 kg P}}{10^6 mg} $

<br>
  
- Vegetation (1.27 kg ha<sup>-1</sup>) (Huggins 2014)
  - https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12155-014-9438-4
  - Harvested straw from all cereals over the course of 3-year WW-SB-SW rotation was 2.9 kg P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>
  
  - This is probably an underestimated assuming baling efficiency, what is removed from field, etc. and doesn't match big plant uptake flux well 
<br> 

#Fluxes:  

- Deposition to Available (0.27 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>)
  - https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2014/em/c3em00641g
  - Assuming this goes to Plant Available pool
<br>
- Plant Uptake from Available (13.95 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>)   - https://agdatacommons.nal.usda.gov/articles/dataset/LTAR_Phosphorus_Budget_Summary/24855381
<br>
- Run-off from Available (0.01 - 0.11 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>)) (Aline)
  - used Aline's LOADEST results and scaled/made a linear model to estimate runoff in other water years based on Q:P from Katie's water budget
<br>
- Hardly available to available (17.40 kg/ha/yr) (based on 0.4% decrease in TP)
  - there is probably a more robust assumption to make here
  - https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-13498-7
  -10% decrease in TP w/o P fertilization from 1989 to 2015. Assume 0.4% flux to available P from non-available P so that plant available remains the same
  - might get reviewer push back from this assumption?
<br>
- Crop residue to soil (0)
  - assume cereal grains have negligible P returns to soil pools
  - https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0038071714000923
<br>  
- Erosion (0)
  - assume minimal for No Till
  - https://www.ars.usda.gov/ARSUserFiles/6233/comparisonOfRunoffAndSoil_2.pdf
 <br>  
- Surface Flow Losses (0)
  - assume minimal based on Katie's water budget

## Runoff Based on WY Budgets

- Tried to estimate DRP in tile drain based on Q:P ratio from Katie's WY budget by scaling and creating a linear model 
  - assumed 0 Qsr for 2017 so I could estimate Q:P
  - used Aline's LOADEST results for 2017 (0.11), 2018 (0.09) DRP values to scale for 2019 - 2023 for the rest of Katie's WY budget


```{r estimate scaled and linear Tile Drain Runoff , results = "asis", warning = FALSE}

# Try scaling by Q:P from Katie's WY budget

p_runoff = data.frame(
  year = 2017:2023, 
  q_p = c(0.21, 0.16, 0.14, 0.02, 0.01, 0.07, 0.1)) %>% 
  mutate(p_scaled = round(0.1 * (q_p/0.185), 2)) # use average (0.09 + 0.11), (0.21 + 0.16)

known_data = data.frame(
  year = c(2017, 2018),
  q_p = c(0.21, 0.16),
  P_runoff = c(0.11, 0.09))

# Fit linear model
lm_model = lm(P_runoff ~ q_p, data = known_data)

# Predict P runoff
p_runoff$p_linear = predict(lm_model, newdata = p_runoff)

p_runoff = p_runoff %>%
