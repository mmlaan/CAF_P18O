## CAF P<sup>18</sup>O Modeling

- Google Drive link to pool models: slides 18 and 19 reflect updated 3 pool models (https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1L9LULGrlXJCZPDEcur8qvZ-64E4VLAXurVMf53kx-d4/edit?usp=sharing)

- Have tried 3 pool model (vegetation, plant available P, not available P), 3 pool model (tile drain, plant available P, not available P), 2 pool model (plant available P, not available P), 1 pool model (plant available P)

- No models are currently in steady state

- The 1 pool model is currently not calculating systemAge. need to figure out why if this is of interest 

- Estimated DRP in runoff from Aline's LOADEST results and Katie's WY budgets

- Added plots of transit time changing with estimated DRP based on WY estimates - not sure if this is that helpful, but shows that transit time is faster in WY with greater Q:P

  - All models have similar mean system transit times (~40 years) except for the 1 pool model that is not working

### Pools: 

- Plant Available (308.25 kg ha<sup>-1</sup>) (Aline)
  - Average of 2016/2018 0 - 50 cm toe and top slope Mehlich 3-P and bulk density, depth of sampling? (0.5 m)
  - $\frac{\text{45 }mg}{kg}$ * $\frac{\text{1370 }kg}{m^3}$ * 0.5 m * $\frac{\text{10000 }m^2}{ha}$ * $\frac{1 kg}{10^6 mg}$
  
    - Aline has bulk density reported as mg cm<sup>-3</sup>, but this seems wrong. I've been using the reported values as g cm<sup>-3</sup>


- Hardly Available (4349.75 kg ha<sup>-1</sup>) (Aline)
  - Estimated by subtracting average Mehlich 3-P from average Total P
  - Average of 2016/2018 Total P - Average Mehlich 3-P, bulk density
   - ($\frac{\text{0.68 g TP}}{kg}$ - $\frac{\text{0.045 g Mehlich}} {kg}$) * $\frac{\text{1370 }kg}{m^3}$ * 0.5 m * $\frac{\text{10000 }m^2}{ha}$ * $\frac{1 kg}{10^6 mg}$

  
- Vegetation (1.27 kg ha<sup>-1</sup>) (Huggins 2014)
  - https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12155-014-9438-4
  - Harvested straw from all cereals over the course of 3-year WW-SB-SW rotation was 2.9 kg P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>
  - This is probably an underestimated assuming baling efficiency, what is removed from field, etc. and doesn't match big plant uptake flux well 
<br> 

- Tile Drain (0.01, non-zero pool)
  - Tried to add this to get at tile drain age. when it is just an output, information can be inferred from changing mean transit time of the whole system 
  
  
### Fluxes:  

- Deposition to Available (0.27 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>)
  - https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2014/em/c3em00641g
  - Assuming this goes to Plant Available pool


- Plant Uptake from Available (13.95 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>)
  - https://agdatacommons.nal.usda.gov/articles/dataset/LTAR_Phosphorus_Budget_Summary/24855381


- Run-off from Available (0.01 - 0.11 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>)) (Aline)
  - used Aline's LOADEST results and scaled/made a linear model to estimate runoff in other water years based on Q:P from Katie's water budget


- Hardly available to available (17.40 kg/ha/yr) (based on 0.4% decrease in TP)
  - there is probably a more robust assumption to make here
  - https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-13498-7
  -10% decrease in TP w/o P fertilization from 1989 to 2015. Assume 0.4% flux to available P from non-available P so that plant available remains the same
  - might get reviewer push back from this assumption?
  
  
- Available P to Hardly Available P (1)
  - To get the model to work, a value is required so that all pools have both an input and output. Still need to look at literature here, and may be able to estimate?
    - I could probably try a sensitivity analysis here to see how much this value impacts the model


- Crop residue to soil (1)
  - The paper below assumes cereal grains have negligible P returns to soil pools. However, to get the model to work, a value is required so that all pools have both an input and output
    - I could probably try a sensitivity analysis here to see how much this value impacts the model
  - https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0038071714000923


- Erosion (0)
  - assume minimal for No Till
  - https://www.ars.usda.gov/ARSUserFiles/6233/comparisonOfRunoffAndSoil_2.pdf


- Surface Flow Losses (0)
  - assume minimal based on Katie's water budget


```{r Define Pools and Fluxes}

## Pools
plant_p = 308.25 #plant available p, assume this always stays the same to ensure same production

#make this dynamic to reflect decreasing P over time?
non_available_p = 4349.75 # non plant available p
vegetation = 13.95 #1.27 # vegetation
tile_drain = 0.01 # small pool, can't be 0 in model

## Fluxes
# Inputs
deposition = 0.27 #deposition
#Outputs (subsurface flow defined later by WY)
#veg_loss = 12.68 # have to have this to not break model, need to look into P loss in veg better

veg_loss = 13.78# also try 0.17, 13.95

```

## Runoff Based on WY Budgets

- Tried to estimate DRP in tile drain based on Q:P ratio from Katie's WY budget by scaling (_scaled in dataframes and plots) and creating a linear model (_linear in dataframes and plots)
  - assumed 0 Qsr for 2017 so I could estimate Q:P
  - used Aline's LOADEST results for 2017 (0.11), 2018 (0.09) DRP values to scale for 2019 - 2023 for the rest of Katie's WY budget
    - similar results for the two methods. DRP ranges from 0.01 - 0.11 for scaled and 0.03 - 0.11 for linear model
